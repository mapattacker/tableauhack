Color coding worksheets makes it easier to differentiate which group them belong to.

Hide tabs in dashboard
-----------------------
If you have too many worksheets, you can hide them by right clicking a dashboard and hide all associated worksheets.
Unhide all of them with the same function.

To show each of them individually to worksheet view, there are two options.
Note that they will be hidden when you go to another tab. 
You will need to right-click that worksheet tab and unhide it for it to stay.

Organise Datafields
--------------------
For proper organisation, it is better to create folders and drop datafields into folder categories.
We can search for specific fields using the search box.
