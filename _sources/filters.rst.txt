Filters
=========

Parameter to Change Views
--------------------------
To swap two or more charts based on a filter, a parameter needs to be created with the possible selectors.
Here is an example of two views using daily and weekly bar chart.

.. figure:: images/changeview1.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

|
Then, we create one calculated field and dump the parameter field in.

.. figure:: images/changeview2.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

|
Add the daily chart in a dashboard and also the parameter called interval. 
Make sure it is selected as daily.

.. figure:: images/changeview3.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

|
Pass the calculated field into filters and select 'Daily' at the Daily Barchart worksheet.

.. figure:: images/changeview4.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

|
Now select 'Weekly' in the parameter, and at the Weekly Barchart worksheet, pass the calculated field into filters,
and select 'Weekly'.

.. figure:: images/changeview5.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center

|
Lastly, add a vertical object into the Dashboard, and add both views into the object.


Filter Last Date
-----------------
How do you only show data from the most recent date?
This trick is sourced from http://kb.tableau.com/articles/howto/filter-on-last-date-in-the-data-source.
It is achieved from the filter pop-up > Top tab.

.. figure:: images/orderbydate.PNG
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
Top Bottom N
-------------
This trick is to have two parameters, one having an option of filtering ``Top N`` & ``Bottom N``, or show ``(All)``.
The discussion is in this link_.

.. _link: https://community.tableau.com/thread/213753

First create these two parameters.

.. figure:: images/filter2.png
    :width: 200px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
Second, create a new field that aligns the field of interest in ascending order.

.. code::
  
  rank([Speed],'asc')

Last, create a logic for linking to the two parameters

.. code::
  
  IF [Filter] = '(All)'
  THEN TRUE
  ELSEIF [Filter] = 'Top N' AND [rank] <= [N]
  THEN TRUE
  ELSEIF [Filter] = 'Bottom N' 
      # reverses the values of your rank field so that you can select bottom N 
      # using the same calculation that works for top N
      AND ((([rank] - WINDOW_MAX([rank])) *-1) +1) <= [N]
  THEN TRUE
  ELSE FALSE END
