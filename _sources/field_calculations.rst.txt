Calculations
====================

Edit
----
In case you have too many calculated fields swimming in a sea of fields, this is a way to quickly find and edit them.

Adhoc Calculations
-------------------
Ad-hoc_ calculations are calculations that you create on the fly, avoiding the need to create a field calculation.

Ad-hoc calculations are supported on the **Rows, Columns, Marks, and Measure Values shelves**; they are not supported on the **Filters or Pages** shelves.
They can be created by double clicking an existing field or empty space at the shelf.

Note that ad-hoc calculations are not available when you create groups, sets, hierarchies, or parameters.


Logical Functions
------------------


.. code:: 
  
  CASE right(left([Startdate], 7), 2) 
    WHEN '01' THEN 'Jan'
    WHEN '02' THEN 'Feb'
    WHEN '03' THEN 'Mar'
    WHEN '04' THEN 'Apr'
    WHEN '05' THEN 'May'
    WHEN '06' THEN 'Jun'
    WHEN '07' THEN 'Jul'
    WHEN '08' THEN 'Aug'
    WHEN '09' THEN 'Sep'
    WHEN '10' THEN 'Oct'
    WHEN '11' THEN 'Nov'
    WHEN '12' THEN 'Dec'
  END



LOD
---------------------

LOD expressions is an important Tableau field calculation that allows calculations to subsets of one or more dimensions. 
There are 3 types of LODs: ``Fixed``, ``Include`` & ``Exclude``. More in this link_.

.. _link: https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/calculations_calculatedfields_lod_overview.html


Below is an example. Red is the desired output. It should give a "Y" for types of Species, e.g., 
Cat, when just one or more contains a Disease marked by "1". Original question from here_.

.. figure:: images/lod1.png
    :width: 300px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center

.. code:: 
  
  #-- This will give 1 if any species have at least a disease
  {FIXED [Species]:MAX([Disease])}

  #-- Change the 1 to 'Y' and 'N' for otherwise
  IF {FIXED [Species]:MAX([Disease])} = 1 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END

Others
--------

Concat Strings
**************

.. code::
  
  [StartDay] + '-' + [StartMonth]
