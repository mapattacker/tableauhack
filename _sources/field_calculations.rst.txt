Calculations
====================

Edit
----
In case you have too calculated fields swimming in a sea of fields, this is a way to quickly find and edit them.

Adhoc Calculations
-------------------
Ad-hoc_ calculations are calculations that you can create and update as you work with a field on a shelf in the view.
It differs from field calculations as they do not require a name.

Ad-hoc calculations are supported on the **Rows, Columns, Marks, and Measure Values shelves**; they are not supported on the **Filters or Pages** shelves.
They can be created by double clicking an existing field or empty space at the shelf.

Level of Detail (LOD)
---------------------

LOD expressions is an important Tableau field calculation that allows calculations to subsets of one or more dimensions. 
There are 3 types of LODs: ``Fixed``, ``Include`` & ``Exclude``. More in this link_.

Below is an example. Red is the desired output. It should give a "Y" for types of Species, e.g., 
Cat, when just one or more contains a Disease marked by "1". Original question from here_.

    :figclass: align-center

.. code:: 
  
  #-- This will give 1 if any species have at least a disease
  {FIXED [Species]:MAX([Disease])}

  #-- Change the 1 to 'Y' and 'N' for otherwise
  IF {FIXED [Species]:MAX([Disease])} = 1 THEN 'Y' ELSE 'N' END
