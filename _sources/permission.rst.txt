Permissions
============

User Roles
-----------
In Tableau Server, user roles can be defined at several levels, with viewer being the lowest.
However, viewer does not have access to any form of interaction, including quick filters, parameters, and action filters.
Only the interactor role and above have access to them.

There will be an additional option during publishing to add a thumbnail to user/groups. Select accordingly.


Column Specific Filters
------------------------

There are currently no column specific filters, but it can be done from row specific filters by not selecting any of the categories 
for that column.
