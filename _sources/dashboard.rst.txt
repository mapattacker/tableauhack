Dashboard
============

Action
-------
To have interactivity between charts within a dashboard, you will need to add an *Action*. Go to Dashboard > Action.
There are 3 types of actions **Filter**, **Url**, and **Highlight**.

    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center
    

Action Filter
**************

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

Layout
-------

Default
********

.. figure:: images/dashboard3.png
    :width: 250px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

You can select a fixed, custom, or range of sizes for default.

Note that the Default dashboard is the parent while the device dashboards are children.

Therefore, any view, filter, action, legend or parameter that you want to add to a device 
layout must first exist in the Default dashboard. 
However, each device layout can contain independent web, image, text, and layout objects.

Device
----------------

If you remove an item from the device layout, it's only removed from that layout. 
It still exists on the default dashboard and can be added back to the layout again, or to other device layouts.

You can only change the layout dimensions and sizing in preview modes.
You are not allowed to edit the content, action filters, or other things.
