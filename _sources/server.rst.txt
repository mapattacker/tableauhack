Tableau Server
================

Installation
--------------

Take a look at the official Tableau Server Linux guide, link provided at resources (bottom).

Note that if your server is off the internet, you will need to make an offline license activation_.

TSM Commands
-------------

To enable tableau services manager (TSM) after installation, use this ``source /etc/profile.d/tableau_server.sh``

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

|

Logs of tsm is kept in ``/home/xxx/.tableau/tsm/tsm.log``. 
However, you can use ``tsm maintenance ziplogs`` to zip up the log file.


Distributed Cluster
--------------------
Each node will have to be installed with Tableau Server to distribute the processes from the master node, but note the requirements_.

Tableau has a recommended list_ of distributed configurations for single, two-node and 
high availability cluster. This is to configure for high extraction, high user usage, and redundancy prevention.

Here is an example_ to configure a 3-node HA cluster, more specific to linux.

.. _requirements: http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v10.5/server-linux/en-us/distrib_requ_linux.htm

.. _list: https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/distributed_install_recommendations.htm

.. _example: http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v10.5/server-linux/en-us/distrib_ha_install_3node_linux.htm


Below is an example of how to set the processes.

.. code:: bash
  
  # example
  tsm topology set-process -n node3 -pr clustercontroller -c 1
  tsm topology set-process -n node2 -pr backgrounder -c 2

After any configurations, you have to first apply the changes via ``tsm pending-changes apply``, 
and Tableau Server will be automatically restarted if the application is successful.
If not (sometimes errors occur), you will need to start up the Server manually using ``tsm start``.



Server Status
----------------

In Tableau Server administration GUI, under status, you can see the real-time statuses of the processes run by the server.
This can only be seen by the Server Administrator.

If it is functioning properly, processes will show as Active, Busy or Passive (Repository). 
Otherwise, you can troubleshoot from this page_.

Uninstallation
---------------
You may either uninstall_ Tableau Server or use the obliterate_ script to remove all instances & files of Tableau Server from the computer.
For the latter, it can be run after uninstallation too to remove traces of the Server. For that, the script can be found in
the ``/var/tmp`` directory. Otherwise, the script can be run using the commend 

.. code::
  
  sudo /opt/tableau/tableau_server/packages/scripts.<version>/tableau-server-obliterate -y -y -y
  

.. _uninstall: http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v10.5/server-linux/en-us/uninstall_linux.htm
