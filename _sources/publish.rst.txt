Publish an Extract
---------------------
To publish an extract to Tableau Server or Tableau Public (by default an extract is needed), we need to create an extract of the dataset first.
This can be done by two ways.

First we can do it at the worksheet view, right click a datasource and extract.

    :width: 550px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

Or we can go to the datasource view and choose Extract. To define the resolution of extract, click edit and choose the options accordingly.
