Custom Stuff
============

Color Palettes
---------------
New color palettes can be added at the ``\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Preferences.tps`` file.
You can add new palettes manually by editing the file, or replace it with another tps that someone build.
Note to change the name back to ``Preferences.tps``.

An excellent list of palettes is from the famous Color Brewer. 
Someone has created it for Tableau, which can be downloaded here_.
