Tableau Forum
--------------
Tableau Forum (https://community.tableau.com/community/forums) is the number 1 help for Tableau issues.
Many Zen Masters and Tableau professionals spend their time helping other users to resolve technical stuff
at a very efficient time. Because of their expertise, sometimes I find their solutions can be better than
the official Tableau Support.

Tableau Support (https://www.tableau.com/case-search-test) allows you to submit a case to Tableau directly.
Their support staff will *always* assist you in a very timely manner.
