SQL
===

For production development, it is preferred to do most of the ETL and especially aggregation in the database
so that data being fed to Tableau is much smaller.

This is a key performance requirement since the database engine is usually more powerful.

Datetime Slicing
*****************

.. code:: sql

  #-- Show Only Time at Axis
  #-- Set date as constant so that Tableau can group by time only
  SELECT to_char(DATE_TIME, '1900-01-01 HH24:MI')::timestamp
  FROM table_nm


  #-- Time Slice
  #-- change 900 to appropriate seconds, e.g., 15 mins == 15 * 60 = 900
  #-- convert timestamp to epoch, divide by interval desired in minutes then round to get the desired interval
  SELECT to_timestamp(floor((extract('epoch' from starttime) / 900 )) * 900) 
  FROM tablename


Restrict Datetime Range
**********************************

.. code:: sql

  #--Filter Date Range
  WHERE trunc(DATE_TIME) BETWEEN :strt_1_tme and :end_1_tme;


  #--Filter Time Range
  WHERE (to_char(DATE_TIME,'hh24:mi') between :stme1 and :etme1))


  #--Filter Fixed Time Range
  where transactiontimestamp between now()::timestamp - interval '24 hour' 
        and now()::timestamp


  #--Filter Latest Data by DateTime
  where transactiontimestamp = (select max(transactiontimestamp) from joins limit 1)

Gap Fill
**********
Gap Filling is very important to fulfil the aesthetics of a visualisation. 
Lets say a barchart is supposed to have *1 dimension* with 10 attributes to show. 
But the dataset only contain 5 at this time. The barchart will only show 5 bars.

This is bad for aesthetics as the bar width will resize whenever a new row show a new attribute of that dimension.

.. figure:: images/gapfill1.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
    Other attributes will not show as none of the rows have those data
    
To prevent that, we can have a union in sql to add all possible attributes in.

.. code:: sql
  
  select col1, col2, dimension from table1
  union
  select null as col1,
          null as col2,
          dimension
  from mapping_table


.. figure:: images/gapfill2.png
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
    Other attributes will show now.


Another time of gap fill occurs when we have a visualisation with *more than 1 dimension*.
The previous code will not do as it will produce this. A example is a heatmap shown below.

.. figure:: images/gapfill3.PNG
    :width: 450px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
    All the nulls will be filled only for 1 of the dimension.

A *cross-join* for the new table for union in SQL is necessary for this case to fill every 
single gap for both dimensions. Now it is perfect!

.. code:: sql

  #--generate_series() is exclusive for postgresql
  
  select col1, col2, dimension1, date_dimension2 from table1
  where date_dimension2 between '2007-02-01'::timestamp and '2008-04-01'::timestamp
  
  union
  
  select col1, col2, dimension1, date_dimension2 from
  
  #--table1 for cross join
  (select null as col1,
          null as col2,
          dimension
  from mapping_table) a
  
  cross join
  
  #--table2 for cross join
  (select date_trunc('day', dd)::date as date_dimension2
   from generate_series
          ('2007-02-01'::timestamp, 
           '2008-04-01'::timestamp,
           '1 day'::interval) dd) b

Parameter with (ALL) option
**********************************
One of the disadvantages of Parameters to Quick Filters among other things is that it lacks a select ALL option.
However, we can manually code for this in SQL.

.. code:: sql

  #-- with (All) option
  
  	#--either define a table with possible and (All) attributes, and define in WHERE clause
  with filter_week AS (select 'Weekend' AS weektype, 'Weekend' AS param
  			  UNION select 'Weekday' AS weektype, 'Weekday' AS param
  			  UNION select 'Weekday' AS weektype, '(All)' AS param
  			  UNION select 'Weekend' AS weektype, '(All)' AS param)
  SELECT * FROM DBO.table_nm a
  WHERE WEEKTYPE IN (SELECT weektype FROM filter_week WHERE param=:week);


  	#--or just entirely in the WHERE clause as below
  WHERE (((time_belt='Morning' OR time_belt='Day' OR time_belt= 'Evening') AND :timebelt='(All)') OR (time_belt=:timebelt))
